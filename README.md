# RAXY Event

RAXY Event is a lightweight event system inspired by Unity's Timeline Signal Emitter.  
It encapsulates event actions inside ScriptableObjects, allowing them to be invoked cleanly and consistently across different assemblies.

## Features
- ScriptableObject-based event actions
- Easy cross-assembly event invocation
- Decouples gameplay logic from event triggers
